# Project Description
EnvironMarket is a tool that allows users to analyze the environmental impacts of their investments. Using an environmental data API when fully functional (not yet implemented), the system allows a user to view a companyâ€™s profile, which includes its financial and environmental information. The financial information is like many stock trading platforms, showing fluctuations in  stock prices, while the environmental information comes in the form of an overall rating, made up of several other sub ratings based on different environmental practices. A user can have a portfolio that shows financial gains across all investments, a cumulative rating for all companies on the portfolio, and the ability to save the contents of the portfolio for further use (via a login). The intended users can be environmentally curious non investors, sustainability driven investors, or anyone in between. Most likely, they will be someone who cares about the environmental impact of their investments and wants to contribute positively via their financial investments. These users will need to keep track of the net gains/losses of their portfolio, and how each company contributes financially/environmentally. They will want to reinvest if a company does not benefit them or the environment. <br/>

# Proposal
During the initial stages of my project, I identified an opportunity to create an interface that revolves around addressing the concerns of environmentally conscious users, those who are interested in the impact of their investments in organizations. With a focus on climate change, pollution, deforestation, and other forms of environmental degradation, I aimed to create a platform that would enable users to assess the practices of companies that affect these issues, and make informed decisions about their investments. To come up with ways to approach this problem, I brainstormed a list of 50+ ideas that could be used as a starting point for a useful feature. I then narrowed them down, and combined them into ideas for feasible features that I planned on including in my intital prototype. I also came up with a list of possible user needs and usability goals to follow throughout the development of this prototype, because ultimately, my goal is to solve an existing issue that users face. Throughout the process, I considered similar existing ideas like Betterment (an investing platform focused on social issues), but I aimed to differentiate my project by offering a free-to-use, transparent platform that caters to both curious beginners and experienced traders, providing a wealth of data to support informed decision-making. <br/><br/>

# Low-Fidelity Prototype
The creation of the low-fidelity prototype was based on the ideas, user needs, and usabilty goals from the initial proposal. I also made sure to establish a specific focus for the interface, and what kind of feedback would be most beneficial to receive. Here are screenshots from the low-fidelity prototype, using a prototyping software called Balsamiq: <br/>

# High-Fidelity Prototype
The creation of the high-fidelity prototype was based on feeback from user testing and heuristic evaluations, which gave critical information on what aspects of the interface could be improved to for better functionality, and to meet user needs. I also made sure to have a strong focus on visual cohesion through the use of color, typography, and an overall aesthetic design. Once the high-fidelity prototype was finished, I was able conduct another round of user tests to get even more information on how to improve the interface. I used a questionare gain insight into several users' experiences witt using the prototype, each individual having varying levels of experience with similar interfaces. This allowed me to make some final conlcusions on which features satisfied user needs, and which did not.
